This folder contains a project created for my Code Rage 2018 session on creating a multi-device game with no coding skills.

To look the session record, access to Code Rage 2018 for free at https://vasur.fr/coderage2018

You need Delphi and FireMonkey if you want to open, edit and compile this project.
Download a trial or the Community Edition from https://www.embarcadero.com/

You can freely use this project as a game template but you don't have the right to use the images in it.

Contact me at https://developpeur-pascal.fr/contact/ if you have questions.
